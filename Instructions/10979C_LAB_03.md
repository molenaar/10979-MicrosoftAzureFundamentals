# Module 3: Virtual machines in Microsoft Azure
# Lab: Creating a VM in Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Orders at A. Datum Corporation have increased significantly. Currently, the order system runs on an on-premises server which provides other services. You have decided to migrate the order system to a dedicated Azure VM. The VM must include sufficient local storage to accommodate increased volume of orders.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create an Azure VM by using the Azure Portal.
-   Connect to a VM by using RDP.
-   Attach a data disk to a VM.
-   Create a multidisk volume by using Storage Spaces.
>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: **30 minutes**

Virtual machine:  **10979C-MIA-CL1**

User name:  **Admin**

Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available VM environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1.   On the host computer, start  **Hyper-V Manager**.
2.   In Hyper-V Manager, click  **10979C-MIA-CL1**, and then in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.
3.   In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the VM starts. 
4.   Sign in by using the following credentials: 

  -   User name:  **Admin**
  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

5.   You also need to start  **MSL-TMG1** for Internet access.


## Exercise 1: Create a VM from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace image
  
### Scenario
  
To prepare for deployment of a new Azure-dedicated VM, you decide to test the process of creating a new Azure VM from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter image.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Select and create a VM
2.   Verify VM creation


#### Task 1: Select and create a VM
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer and browse to  **http://portal.azure.com**. Sign in to the Azure Portal as the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure Portal, create a new VM by using the Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter Marketplace image and Resource Manager deployment model with the following settings:
  -   Name:  **labvm1**

  -   VM disk type:  **HDD**

  -   User name:  **Student**

  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd1234**

  -   Subscription: **_Your Azure subscription_**

  -   Resource group:  **Create New**

  -   New resource group:  **labvm1RG**

  -   Location: **_Azure datacenter closest to the classroom location_**

  -   Size:  **D1 Standard**

  -   Storage account: **Accept the default value (this will create a new storage account)**

  -   Virtual network: **Accept the default value (this will create a new virtual network)**

  -   Subnet:  **default (10.0.0.0/24)**

  -   Public IP address:  **(new) labvm1-ip**

  -   Network security group:  **(new) labvm1-nsg**

  -   Extensions:  **No extensions**

  -   Diagnostics:  **Disabled**

  -   Availability set: **None**

3.   Note the  **Deployment started** message in the notification area at the top of the page.
4.   Wait for the deployment to complete.


#### Task 2: Verify VM creation
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure Portal, once the deployment of the labvm1 VM completes, you will be automatically presented with the  **labvm1** blade and its **Settings** blade. If you are not presented with the **Settings** blade automatically, click the **labvm1** tile.
2.   In the  **Settings** blade, click **Activity logs**. This will automatically display the  **Events** blade.
3.   In the  **Events** blade, scroll down to the list of events. Review events associated with successful creation of the VM.
4.   Scroll to the left to the  **Settings** blade and click **Resource health**.
5.   In the  **Resource health** blade, verify that there are no known Azure platform problems affecting this VM. Click **Refresh** if you receive a "Resource health unknown' message.
6.   Close the Resource health blade.

>  **Result**: After completing this lab, you should have:Created a Microsoft Azure virtual machine (VM) from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace image.Verified creation of the new Azure VM and review corresponding Audit logs.


## Exercise 2: Verify the functionality of the VM
  
### Scenario
  
You successfully deployed your lab Azure VM running Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter. Now you want to examine its properties from the Azure Portal and connect to it by using RDP.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   View the properties of the VM
2.   Connect to a VM


#### Task 1: View the properties of the VM
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure Portal, ensure that you are focused on the  **labvm1** blade and its **Settings** blade.
2.   In the  **labvm1** blade, review the **Essentials** section. You will notice that the VM has a public IP address, but not a corresponding Domain Name System (DNS) name label. In addition, the **Connect** button will be enabled.
3.   Scroll to the left to the  **Settings** blade and click **Properties**.
4.   Notice that the VM also has a private IP address and the VM agent with a status of  **Ready**.


#### Task 2: Connect to a VM
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure Portal, from the  **labvm1** blade, establish an RDP connection to the **labvm1** VM by using the following credentials:

  -   User name:  **Student**

  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd1234**

2.   Wait until the connection is successfully established.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have:Viewed properties of an Azure VM from the Azure Portal.Connected to an Azure VM by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).


## Exercise 3: Configure storage of a VM
  
### Scenario
  
Once you establish an RDP connection to your VM, you want to test the Storage Spaces functionality by first attaching two data disks from the Azure Portal and then configuring them from the operating system that runs within the VM.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Attach data disks to an Azure VM
2.   Create a two-disk volume in the Azure VM that runs Windows
3.   Prepare for the next module


#### Task 1: Attach data disks to an Azure VM
  
1.   From MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure Portal, navigate to the  **Settings** blade of labvm1. If prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the  **Settings** blade of labvm1, attach two new disks with the following settings:
  -   Name: Accept the default

  -   Type:  **Standard**

  -   Size (GB):  **1023**

  -   Location: Accept the default

  -   Host caching:  **None**

3.   Wait until each disk is provisioned and is displayed in the  **Disks** blade.


#### Task 2: Create a two-disk volume in the Azure VM that runs Windows
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, switch to the Remote Desktop session window. If necessary, on the Networks pane, click  **No**.
2.   While connected to the labvm1 Azure VM, from the  **Server Manager** window, create a storage pool named **StoragePool1**, consisting of two newly attached disks. 
3.   From the Server Manager window, create a new virtual disk named  **VirtualDisk1** by using **StoragePool1** with the **Simple** storage layout, the **Fixed** provisioning type, and the maximum size.
4.   From the Server Manager window, create a new 2-TB volume as drive F formatted with the NTFS file system and a default allocation unit.
5.   From the desktop of, labvm1 open File Explorer and verify that there is a new drive F with 2 TB of available disk space.
6.   Close the Remote Desktop session to labvm1.
7.   On MIA-CL1, from the Azure Portal, stop labvm1.
8.   Close all open windows on MIA-CL1.


#### Task 3: Prepare for the next module
  
When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the VMs. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

>  **Result**: After completing this lab, you should have:Attached two data disks to the Azure VM from the Azure Portal. Created a two-disk volume in an Azure VM that runs Windows Server 2012 R2 by using Storage Spaces.



**Question** 
What type of connection can you establish to the VM in Azure by default?
